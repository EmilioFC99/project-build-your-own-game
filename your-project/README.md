## Project Description
We make our first game in python, 21-Blackjack but simplified without 'Split' option, betting and only 11 as the value of As.
21 Blackjack was like the first game that came to our minds and while we were discussing it we thought it could be easy.

## Workflow
The first day we decided the game, then we made our flowchart to know how the games works and what we would be. 
Once we had that done, we began to define what functions we will use and we split them between the two. Finally, we proceeded to code the functions and we joined all parts and fiex problems.

## Organization
How did you organize yourself? Did you use any tools?
We used monday.com to organize the tasks and the time that each of them needed to be done.
