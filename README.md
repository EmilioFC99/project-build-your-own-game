## Project Description
We make our first game in python, 21-Blackjack but simplified without 'Split' option, betting and only 11 as the value of As.
21 Blackjack was like the first game that came to our minds and while we were discussing it we thought it could be easy.

FUNCTIONS:
  - DECK = El deck es el conjunto de cartas del As hasta el Rey en los 4 signos, por un total de 52 elementos. En python se creo como diccionario donde cada llave (cartas)                  corresponde a un valor (los puntos).
  - FUNCTION “SHOW_HAND”: It is the function that, based on the hand dictionary (whether from the player or the dealer) prints the string: "Cards are {deck keys} and the value                             is {the sum of the points on the cards}. 
  - FUNCTION “CHOOSE_WINNER”: It is the function that, based on the sum of points of each player (player and dealer), throws the followings: 
                              If the player's hand > dealer hand and </-21: "Congratilation, you win!!!"
                              If the dealer's hand < player's hand and </-21: "You lose"
                              If the dealer's hand is the player's hand: "Draw 
  - Function "

## Workflow
The first day we decided the game, then we made our flowchart to know how the games works and what we would be. 
Once we had that done, we began to define what functions we will use and we split them between the two. Finally, we proceeded to code the functions and we joined all parts and fiex problems.

## Organization
How did you organize yourself? Did you use any tools?
We used monday.com to organize the tasks and the time that each of them needed to be done.
